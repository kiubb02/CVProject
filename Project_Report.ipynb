    "Generally the Dataset consists of labelled Images, which have the labels of age, gender, ethnicity and date&time of when the Image was collected/added to the Dataset. Images themselves are taken from the internet and are therefore not coming from a private collection or database leading to them being labelled by the DEX algorithm and double-checked by a human annotator.\n",

    "All in all there are about 20000 images available in the Set which show different poses and facial expressions of various age/gender/ethnicity groupings.\n",

    "In our case: age, gender and ethnicity are the three most important features for the model and general working conditions of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "For such a diverse Dataset it is important for it to be balanced enough so that each feature is represented in the same amount according to the size of the Dataset.\n"
